Fortress management

- personal level is based on hoarded gold
- hire minions to go on raids and guard fortress
- progression of towns/castles available for raiding
- armor for raid defense

Two phases:
	- Raiding phase
		-Flappy bird like controls
		-Can launch fireballs and swoop on defenses, villagers, soldiers to do damage
		-Need to clear the fortress/castle at the end of each level
		-Levels get progressively harder
		-Earlier levels require carrying gold
			-the more you carry, the slower you can fly
	
	-Lair phase
		-buy minions for defense & automatic collection of gold during village raids
		-buy traps/defenses for the lair
		-defend against adventurers trying to steal gold/attack you/attack minions
		-Adventurer/army strength based on gold collected so far (not neccessarily amount currently stored)
